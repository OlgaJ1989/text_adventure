# STRANDED. A text-based adventure game.

![Gameplay]()

STRANDED is a Python terminal game inspired by classic text-based adventure games such as Zork. It runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The player's goal is to survive and get off a deserted island that they are stranded on after a plane crash. The player's survival depends on the decisions they make during the game.
